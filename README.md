# Swell.js - Headless ecommerce storefront SDK

Universal JavaScript client for Swell's Frontend API, providing client-safe access to store and customer data. You can use it in JAMstack or SSR apps to:

- Fetch products, categories, store settings, nav menus, and custom content
- Create, recover, and update shopping carts
- Build custom checkout and subscription flows
- Authenticate customers and allow them to edit account details, orders, and subscriptions
- Resolve linked content to dynamically generate page URLs
- Format prices in the store's currency

> This SDK implements a subset of operations available in Swell's [Backend API](https://developers.swell.is/backend-api/) and is authorized with a public key + session token, making it safe to use in any context. You should only use the Backend API server-side, and keep your secret keys stored as environment variables.
